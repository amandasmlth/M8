TITLE: Deck the Binary Search Tree

EXPLANATION: The in_threads prevent the versus to be played one after each other. When you press run, only one verse (both treble and clef) at each time. If you want to hear the entire song, uncomment the verse 1/2 section and play that twice, then comment that back, uncomment verse 3, play that, then comment that back, uncomment verse 4 and play that. The repeat one more time for the entire song. The code-generated full song must be spliced together for the whole cohesive sound.
