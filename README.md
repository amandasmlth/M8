TITLE: Deck the Binary Search Tree

EXPLANATION: The in_threads prevent the versus to be played one after each other. When you press run, only one verse (both treble and clef) plays because when they are all uncommented, they play on top of each other and that sounds terrible. If you want to hear the entire song, uncomment the verse 1/2 section and play that twice, then comment that back, uncomment verse 3, play that, then comment that back, uncomment verse 4 and play that. The repeat one more time for the entire song. The code-generated full song must be spliced together for the whole cohesive sound. If you follow the instructions above, you should hear the melody of the classic Christmas song, "Deck the Halls" with arpeggio chords that add some life to the basic melody.
